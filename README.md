# OCaml-2D-Physics-Engine
A work in progress 2D physics engine created in OCaml. It is meant to be general purpose so that it may be easily customized and used to execute various projects such as simple 2D games. 

Goal: Include kinematics, elastic and inelastic collisions, and rotational physics. 

Method: Model-View-Update

Current position: The roadmap for kinmatics and collisions has been laid out, but not emplemented. Rotational physics planning to begin after implementation of kinematics and collisions.
